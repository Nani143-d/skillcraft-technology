## 🔐 Task 01 - SkillCraft Technology

This project is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption algorithm using Python. The Caesar Cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Encrypt a message using a shift value
- Decrypt a message using a shift value
- User input for custom message and shift value

---

## 📌 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each character in the message by a specified number of positions.  
For example:
- Original: `HELLO`
- Shift: `3`
- Encrypted: `KHOOR`
